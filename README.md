DESCRIPTION :
  This Task is centered on bringing data from an external source through an API and turning it into a bar graph for easier understanding. The main focus is on taking information that comes in a structured but plain format and representing it visually so that patterns and comparisons are immediately clear.
  
  This task is a weather application that provides real-time weather information such as temperature, humidity, and conditions for any city entered by the user. It can be applied in daily life to quickly check weather updates, plan travel, or schedule outdoor activities. The project was developed in Python, and I used PyCharm as the development environment.
  
  The process begins with an API request. The program is designed to connect to a specific API and collect the response. The response usually comes in JSON format, which is a structured way of delivering data. However, JSON often contains many details, and not all of them are necessary. The program carefully extracts the parts that are important for the analysis. This step ensures that only the required values are passed forward, keeping the work simple and avoiding extra noise.

Once the data is filtered, the program prepares it for visualization. A bar graph is used to represent the final output. The reason for this choice is that bar graphs are straightforward for comparing values across different categories. Each bar stands for one category, and the height of the bar shows the value. Without needing to read through large tables of numbers, the result is visible instantly. Larger values appear as taller bars, while smaller values appear as shorter ones, making the comparison quick and clear.

In terms of execution, the program runs step by step. It begins by importing the required libraries, then makes the API request to fetch data. After receiving the response, the data is stored and the necessary values are extracted. These values are then mapped to the bar graph, and the chart is displayed with proper labels. The labels help in identifying what each bar represents, while the graph itself highlights the differences between the values.

A key feature of this program is its ability to always present the most recent data. Every time the program is run, it directly connects to the API and collects the current information. There is no need to prepare files in advance or enter numbers manually. This automatic connection to a live data source gives the program a dynamic quality and ensures accuracy.

Another important aspect is the clarity that visualization brings. Numbers in text format can often look confusing or overwhelming, but the moment they are displayed as a bar graph, the meaning becomes much easier to grasp. This makes the program useful for situations where updated data needs to be monitored and compared quickly.

Overall, the program follows a clear sequence: connect to the API, collect the data, extract what is required, and display it as a bar graph. This simple but effective process turns raw data into meaningful visuals that can be read and understood in seconds. The project shows how live data can be transformed into clear and informative results through automation and visualization.
